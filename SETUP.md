YouTrack App Setup Instructions
===
Follow these steps to install and configure the YouTrack app using either a permanent auth Token or OAuth credentials.


## Using A Permanent Auth Token

To install the YouTrack app you must first create an API token. Head over to your YouTrack cloud account, the URL will look something
like `https://<my_company>.youtrack.cloud/` or your own instance.

Once you've logged in, navigate to the "Profile Settings" section (under your user profile menu, top right of the screen).

Next, go to the "Account Security" tab. Here you'll find the "Tokens" section and click on the button "New token..."

Enter a name for the new API token (this can be anything you like). In the following example we've named it "YouTrack Deskpro App" and select the `YouTrack` scope.

After creating the token, copy it for a later step. It's **important that you keep your secret API token safe**.

Close the modal window, and you can see your token in the list

> __Note:__ If you have multiple URLs and one Deskpro instance, you must configure it.
> Click on the "Gear" icon -> "Server Settings" -> "Global Settings". And on the "Resource Sharing" section specify:
> 1. select "Allow all origins" to access all your sites to the YouTrack
> 2. or list all your URLs in "Allowed origins" for more security

Ok, now head back to Deskpro and navigate to the "Settings" tab of the YouTrack App.

From this screen, enter the following details:

* **YouTrack Instance URL** - this is your YouTrack URL (e.g. this will be `my_company` if your YouTrack URL is `https://my_company.youtrack.cloud`) or the URL of your own YouTrack instance
* **Permanent Token** - this is the token you created in the previous steps

To configure who can see and use the YouTrack app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".


## Using OAuth

To install the YouTrack app using OAuth you'll need to head over to `https://<my_company>.youtrack.cloud/hub/services` to create a new service.

Once you're on the "Services" page click on the "New service..." button.

Next, in the popup modal give your app a name(E.g. Deskpro) and click "Create".

On the next page, you'll see details of your new service. First, click "Trust service" in the top right corner. Then, copy the `ID` and paste it into the `Service ID` field in the Settings drawer in Deskpro.

Next, you'll need to update your service secret. Click `Secret`, and a popup will display your new secret. Copy this value and paste it into the `Service Secret` field in the Settings drawer. Be sure to store the secret securely, as you wonâ€™t be able to view it again in YouTrack Hub.

Finally, copy the Callback URL from Deskpro and paste it into the `Redirect URIs` field.
